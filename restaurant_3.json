The banchan plates are uniformly good, and Deuki Hong’s menu also includes winning dishes like stir-fried squid noodles, kimchi stew, and seafood pancakes. If it’s available, make sure to order the kimchi and rice “lunchbox.” Baekjeong is a great place for large groups and birthday parties."

Two meat and a soup was just prefect for the two of us. We could have done one meat and one soup. The portions of the meat are great! The beef was juicy, tender and so good. The sides were excellent.
